A console command as simple as it gets. Just put "keeprunning" before any other command and it will keep your command
running. If your command exits for any reason, it will be immediately restarted.

Installation

```

Usage
-----

Just put `keeprunning` before any command. Like... `keeprunning ./my-server-thingy`

That's it. Really.
